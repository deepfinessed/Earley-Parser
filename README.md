# Earley Parser

## Description

This is an Earley Parser, or chart parser, made to illustrate the algorithm discussed in class. It is a work in progress

## Usage

For now, you can test the parser with ```python simple-sentence.py``` which will print a parse chart to the console.

The same file also includes a sample of how to write grammar rules that the parser understands.

In the future, I will try to include functionality to create a parse tree from a completed parse - ideally I'd like to have the parser "teach itself" how to parse EBNF grammar, and allow the parser to accept grammar files, but we're a ways away from that.
